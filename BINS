According to a booklet I have from Westpac (an Aussie bank), a card number
starting with 5610 or 56022[1-5] is a BankCard
BankCards have exactly 16 digits.

from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card_number#Prefixes
As of November 8, 2004, MasterCard and Diner's club formed an alliance.
Cards issued in Canada and the USA start with 55 and are treated as
MasterCards worldwide. International cards use the 36 prefix and are
treated as mastercards in Canada and the US, but are treated as Diner's
Club cards elsewhere. Diner's club international's website makes no
reference to old 38 prefix numbers, and they can be presumed reissued under
the 55 or 36 BIN prefix.

Effective October 1, 2006, the Discover Network will activate new Issuer
Identification Numbers (IINs) to support a variety of card types and
products. Additionally, Discover and China Union Pay (CUP) have
established a strategic alliance and reciprocity agreement. As a result,
IIN ranges from CUP will be enabled to facilitate the acceptance of CUP
credit Cards on the Discover Network by October 1, 2006. CUP credit
cards will be enabled on Discover Network with a 16-digit Card Number
only. The updated IIN table is shown below.

Minimum IIN             Maximum IIN             Product
650000          650099          Consumer Debit
650100          650199          Commercial Debit
650200          650399          Stored Value
650400          650599          Stored Value
650600          650799          Consumer Credit
650800          650999          Commercial Credit
651000          659999          Reserved for Future Use

        China Union Pay
62212600                62292599                Credit

Please ensure that your POS terminals, websites and any pertinent
internal systems can accept these new IINs.

from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_(debit_card)#Technical
Laser cards are prefixed with either "6304", "6706", "6771" or "6709", and
may be between 16 and 19 characters in length.

Local Isracard: 8(-9?) digits

From http://www.wysiwyg.co.il/Anatomy-of-CreditCard-Number-formats.asp#IsraCard-algorithm
8-9 digits, non-LUHN validation

From Erik Levinse:
 i think it's like luhn, except instead of 212121... you put
+987654321 under the number you're validating, multiply each, and do mod 11 on
+the sum, instead of mod 10.
