Business::CreditCard

These subroutines tell you whether a credit card number is self-consistent --
whether the last digit of the number is a valid checksum for the preceding
digits.  If you additionally want to process the credit card electronically,
see Business::OnlinePayment <http://www.420.am/business-onlinepayment/>
